# Defining Terms

Words can get unwieldy quickly. Here are a few words/phrases we are using in specific ways throughout our proposal.

## Phoebe

* The _provisional_ name for our next generation web search engine. We aren't committed to this name but it's simpler/shorter to say than "next-generation web search engine".

## Search

* Unless otherwise qualified this is used synonymously with "web search" and "search engine."
