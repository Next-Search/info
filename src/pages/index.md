# The Next Web Search Engine

A better web search engine is possible. Not just incrementally better but exponentially. Such a search engine offers not only drastic improvements in productivity but also seismic changes for good for humanity.

On this site we'll dive deep into what this next generation search engine should look like, a history of search, a survey of the current landscape, and practical steps to implement this next gen engine.

## Bettering Humanity

:::danger Think About It
"The world changes according to the way people see it, and if you alter, even by a millimeter, the way a person looks or people look at reality, then you can change it." - [James Baldwin, New York Times, Sept. 23, 1979](https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/23/archives/james-baldwin-writing-and-talking-baldwin-baldwin-authors-query.html).

Here are a few ways we believe this engine can provide a better future for humanity:

1. The algorithms will be open source. This will increase competition (encouraging innovation) and decrease bias (as issues in the algorithm can be discovered and remedied in an expedient manner).
1. Non-user related data (e.g. search results) will be open. This means that even if our engine fails others will be able to pick up where we left off and continue to innovate.
1. Bad actors attempts to game the results will be significantly complicated resulting in safer and more accurate search results for all.
1. The highly improved quality of results means better results relating to suicide prevent, parenting skills, education resources, unbiased current events reporting, and so on.
1. Results will be human influenced opening up an income possibility for a vast number of individuals - for those who are unemployed, underemployed, discriminated against.
1. An organizational culture that emphasizes sustainable and high quality care for staff, gracious and excellent customer service, and ethical / social / environmental responsibility.

Our point is: this isn't just YASE (yet another search engine) seeking to derive financial profit but a paradigm-shifting, world bettering opportunity.

## What Next?

We have a ton of work to do on updating our proposal for this next generation search engine. In the meantime feel free to [review our 2021 draft](https://github.com/Next-Search/websearch-proposal/blob/master/SUMMARY.md).
