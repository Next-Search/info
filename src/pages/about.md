# About Next Search

Circa 2004 I had an idea for a next generation search engine, something to challenge Google. But I had other responsibilities and I figured Google (or someone else) would build this better search engine without me. The years passed and while occasionally there was some small glimmers of hope Google became ever more dominant and seemingly fixed in its ways and search result quality continued to deterioriate.

Fast forward 16 years and the state of search remains miserable despite tremendous progress in many technological areas. A few other engines have begun offering some interesting alternatives to Google but none have the paradigm shifting power necessary to unthrone Google. So in January 2020 I published a first draft proposal for a next generation search engine. A second draft was released in June 2020 and a third in February of 2021.

Now it is August 2022 and I'm revisiting "the dream" once again. It's an itch that just won't stop.
